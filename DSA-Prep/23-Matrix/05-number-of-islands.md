# Number of Islands

## Problem
Given a grid of land (`1`) and water (`0`), count the number of connected islands. Cells connect vertically and horizontally.

## Intuition
Each unvisited land cell is the start of a new island. Run DFS from it and mark the complete connected component as visited.

## Java
```java
public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < grid.length; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                count++;
                dfs(grid, r, c);
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

private void dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
    if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= grid.length || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] != '1') return;
    grid[r][c] = '0';
    dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
    dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
    dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
    dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
}
```

## Complexity
Time O(rows × cols), space O(rows × cols) worst case for recursion.
